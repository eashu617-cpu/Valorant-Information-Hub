            <h3>Unrated :</h3>
            <p><br>Standard full game.In Valorant, the Unranked game mode is designed for players who want to enjoy the core competitive experience without the pressure of ranks or ratings. It follows the same rules and structure as Competitive mode, including standard maps, agents, and round formats, but matches played in Unranked do not affect a player’s rank. This makes it an ideal mode for beginners to learn game mechanics, for experienced players to practice new agents or strategies, and for teams to coordinate and experiment without consequences. While the matchmaking system still attempts to balance teams based on skill level, the atmosphere is generally more relaxed, allowing players to focus on improving aim, communication, and teamwork at their own pace.<br></p>

            <h3>Competitive</h3>
            <p><br>Ranked version of Unrated.In Valorant, the Ranked (Competitive) game mode is the primary mode for players who want to test their skills in a structured and highly competitive environment. In this mode, players are placed into ranks ranging from Iron to Radiant based on their performance, teamwork, and consistency across matches. Ranked games follow the standard match format, where teamwork, strategy, communication, and individual skill all play crucial roles in determining the outcome. Players must first complete placement matches to receive an initial rank, and subsequent wins or losses affect their Rank Rating (RR), allowing them to climb up or drop down the rank ladder. Ranked mode encourages disciplined gameplay and improvement, as every match directly impacts a player’s standing, making it the most challenging and rewarding experience in Valorant.</p>

            <h3>Spike Rush</h3>
            <p><br>Fast mode with random weapons.In Valorant, Spike Rush is a fast-paced and casual game mode designed for quick matches and stress-free gameplay. Unlike standard modes, Spike Rush features shorter games with fewer rounds, where all players on each team receive the same random weapon every round, removing any economy management. Each round also includes special power-ups called orbs that grant temporary abilities such as increased damage, faster movement, or instant ultimate charges, adding a fun and unpredictable element to the match. Spike Rush is ideal for warming up, completing daily or weekly missions, or trying out new agents in a low-pressure environment, making it a popular choice for players who want quick action without long match commitments.</p>

            <h3>Deathmatch</h3>
            <p><br>Free-for-all aim practice.In Valorant, the Deathmatch game mode is a solo, fast-paced mode focused entirely on improving individual mechanics such as aim, reflexes, and positioning. Players compete against each other in a free-for-all format on standard maps, with no abilities, team coordination, or objectives like planting the spike. The goal is simply to get as many eliminations as possible within the time limit, with instant respawns keeping the action continuous and intense. Deathmatch is commonly used as a warm-up mode before competitive matches, as it helps players practice gunfights and crosshair placement in real combat situations without the pressure of teamwork or winning rounds.</p>
